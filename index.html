<h3><b>WWW:</b></h3>

<br><br>The WorldWideWeb(www) is commonly called as Web. 
The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies: 
Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
It is an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet.
The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed 
by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software 
application called a web server. 
The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over 
two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name, make up a website. 
Websites are stored in computers that are running a web server, which is a program that responds to 
requests made over the Internet from web browsers running on a user's computer. 
Website content can be provided by a publisher, or interactively from user-generated content.

<h4>History of WWW:</h4>

<br><br><p>
The development of the World Wide Web was begun in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues at CERN, 
an international scientific organization based in Geneva, Switzerland. 
They created a protocol, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which standardized communication between 
servers and clients. 
Their text-based Web browser was made available for general release in January 1992.
The World Wide Web gained rapid acceptance with the creation of a Web browser called Mosaic, 
which was developed in the United States by Marc Andreessen and others at the National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois and was released in September 1993. 
Mosaic allowed people using the Web to use the same sort of “point-and-click” graphical manipulations 
that had been available in personal computers for some years. 
In April 1994 Andreessen cofounded Netscape Communications Corporation, whose Netscape Navigator 
became the dominant Web browser soon after its release in December 1994. BookLink Technologies’ InternetWorks, 
the first browser with tabs, in which a user could visit another Web site without opening an entirely new 
window, debuted that same year. 
By the mid-1990s the World Wide Web had millions of active users.
</p>
<p>
The software giant Microsoft Corporation became interested in supporting Internet applications 
on personal computers and developed its own Web browser (based initially on Mosaic), Internet 
Explorer (IE), in 1995 as an add-on to the Windows 95 operating system. 
IE was integrated into the Windows operating system in 1996 (that is, it came “bundled” ready-to-use 
within the operating system of personal computers), which had the effect of reducing 
competition from other Internet browser manufacturers, such as Netscape. IE soon became the most 
popular Web browser. Apple’s Safari was released in 2003 as the default browser on Macintosh personal 
computers and later on iPhones (2007) and iPads (2010). Safari 2.0 (2005) was the first browser with a 
privacy mode, Private Browsing, in which the application would not save Web sites in its history, downloaded 
files in its cache, or personal information entered on Web pages. The first serious challenger to IE’s 
dominance was Mozilla’s Firefox, released in 2004 and designed to address issues with speed and security that 
had plagued IE. In 2008 Google launched Chrome, the first browser with isolated tabs, which meant that when one 
tab crashed, other tabs and the whole browser would still function. By 2013 Chrome had become the 
dominant browser, surpassing IE and Firefox in popularity. Microsoft discontinued IE and replaced it with Edge 
in 2015. In the early 21st century, smartphones became more computer-like, and more-advanced services, 
such as Internet access, became possible. Web usage on smartphones steadily increased, and in 2016 it accounted 
for more than half of Web browsing.

<br><h3>GITAM</h3>
<p>
The Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management, commonly known as GITAM, Visakhapatnam is one of the 
best private engineering Deemed to be University established in 1980. It was previously known as GITAM 
College. GITAM has been approved by UGC. It has been granted the status of deemed to be university in 2007. 
GITAM aims to impart futuristic and comprehensive education of global standards and is responsible for 
imparting education in the field of Engineering and Technology. The university offers 109 programs at 
undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral levels in technology, pharmacy, science, management, international 
business, architecture and law. It is one of the few colleges in India which provide master's degree 
in every field. GITAM Institute of Technology and Management has three campuses at Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad, 
and Bengaluru. GITAM Institute of Technology and Management was ranked 71 among universities in India by 
the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2020[5] and in the 101–150 band in overall category.
